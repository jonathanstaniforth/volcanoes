// The way the world is
- NYC has a taxi service to provide a means of transport

// The issue with the world
- The problem is that demand across the city is distributed unequally
- Therefore, need to work out where taxis need to be in the city

// Why it matters
- This is a difficult problem to work out how to place vehicles
- Placement of taxis affects service availability to customers and number of trips the company can make

// What we will do
- We will optimise the placement of taxis across the city
- We need to find out which area has a great inflow or outflow of cars
- We use a model in this paper and apply it to our situation

// What we have done
- We have processed the data to remove unnecessary columns and rows
